****Design and Optimization of a Lens-Based Diffraction-Limited Earth Observing Telescope for LEO Applications

This project focuses on designing and optimizing a lens-based diffraction-limited Earth observing telescope tailored for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) applications using Zemax OpticStudio. The goal is to achieve high-resolution imaging with minimal aberrations, suitable for remote sensing and Earth observation.

**Objectives**
Design an optical system achieving diffraction-limited performance.
Optimize for high spatial resolution and broad field of view.
Ensure lightweight and compact design for LEO satellite payloads.

**Key Features**
Diffraction-Limited Imaging: Achieving near-theoretical resolution limits with minimal optical aberrations.
Comprehensive Optical Analysis: Includes Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), Point Spread Function (PSF), and aberration evaluations.
Lightweight Design: Optimized lens configurations suitable for spaceborne applications.

**Tools and Software**
Zemax OpticStudio – For optical design, simulation, and optimization.
Python – Used for data analysis and automation scripts.
MATLAB – Utilized for computational analysis and visualization.
